# Moodly
Moodly is a digital tool that allows individuals to record their moods throughout the day and analyze these records to identify emotional patterns. Each individual's mood is influenced by many factors, from social relationships to sleep patterns. Moodly increases psychological resilience by making this awareness a daily habit.
Users receive regular notifications in the morning and evening to record their mood. Users can log in to the app at any time to review their mood analyses and access motivational messages. 

Moodly is designed as a mobile app. The project prototype was created using Python and the Streamlit library.
This project won second place in the hackathon held at the end of the Samsung Innovation Campus education program.
